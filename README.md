# FilmFlix
Project duration - February 2024 to May 2024
## Description

Project for course "Programvareutvikling". A website where users may explore, favorite and give ratings to movies watched similar to IMDB or Letterboxd. Product createed using agile development using SCRUM sprint planning, product backlog, meetings and retrospectives, and some Kanban prioritization guidelines.

Original repository was hosted on university-restricted Gitlab environment, therefore issues, branches, history and commits are not properly imported over. This repository is purely a copy of the source code from the main branch. 

### My contributions

I primarily worked on the Django back-end for the project, specifically the back-end implementations of serializers, models, views, and the communication between back- and front-end. Later contributed with some front-end aswell, specifically the Library and Saving a movie as a rated movie portion of the interface and logic.
